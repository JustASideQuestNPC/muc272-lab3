# _Placeholder Title_ 
A top-down shooter I wrote in a week and a half for a final project. Has a variety of amazing "features", including (but not limited to):
- "Fun" and "engaging" gameplay!
- "High-quality" sound effects!
- "Beautiful" visual design!
- "Polished" and entirely "bug-free"!
- Mildly questionable source code!

_Placeholder Title_ was made with [Processing](https://www.processing.org), a graphics programming language that is actually just a Java library in disguise. The necessary bits of processing are included in the release version of _Placeholder Title_, so all you need to run it is basic Java. You'll still need to download Processing if you want to play with the ~~spaghetti~~ source code for _Placeholder Title_, though.

## How to Play
- Have the [Java Runtime](https://www.java.com/en) and/or [JDK 17+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads) installed on your system.
  - Processing runs on JDK 17, so if you have that installed then _Placeholder Title_ will run just fine. Probably.
- Download `placeholder-title.jar` from the latest release.
- Run `placeholder-title.jar` and brace yourself for an "amazing" gaming experience!
